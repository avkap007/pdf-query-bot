    "summary": "The review focused on the Board's decision to impose a $32,145.67 administrative penalty against the employer for violations identified during an inspection on August 13, 2024. The employer, a prime contractor for construction projects, was found to have various violations related to traffic control, balcony decks, falling object hazards, stairways, and coordination of health and safety at the worksite. The Review Officer, Tony Fletcher, considered the evidence presented, including the inspection report and the employer's submissions. The employer did not dispute the initiating orders but contested the penalty amount, seeking its cancellation or reduction. After reviewing the violations, including Section 4.32 regarding safe access to work areas, the Review Officer upheld the penalty amount of $32,145.67, concluding that the violations warranted the imposed penalty."

The employer argued that they were unaware of the unsafe work history of these affiliated firms and had a clean record themselves. The owner had prior experience in the industry and had taken steps to ensure compliance, including obtaining a Level 2 Asbestos Certificate. \n\nThe decision hinged on whether the employer had provided false information or failed to meet requirements under the Act. The Board cited Policy Item P2-59.03-1, which allows for refusal of a licence if there is a contravention that poses a risk of serious harm. The Board officer considered the inspection histories of affiliated firms in making the decision. Ultimately, the Board upheld its decision to refuse the licence, citing concerns about potential risks to workers and others. \n\nTherefore, the original penalty of refusing the employer an Asbestos Abatement Licence was upheld in this review."

The penalty amount is confirmed at $2,502.51, as the employer did not dispute the violation or provide evidence of due diligence to prevent the non-compliance. The penalty is upheld as the employer did not establish that it exercised due diligence to prevent the circumstances that led to the violation. \n\nIn summary, the original penalty was upheld, and the employer's request to cancel the penalty was denied.

However, the review officer upheld the Board's decision, stating that the employer, as the prime contractor, was responsible for ensuring health and safety at the workplace. Therefore, the original penalty was upheld, and the employer was found to be in violation of the Regulation."

The review officer upheld the administrative penalty of $59,416.75, as the employer failed to take sufficient precautions to prevent work-related injuries, as outlined in section 95(1) of the Act. The original penalty was upheld based on the findings of the review."

Review Officer Nick Attewell, authorized to make decisions on requests for extensions of time under section 274 of the Workers Compensation Act, found that special circumstances indeed precluded the applicant from filing on time.

Subsection (2) specifies that the plan must include certain elements, such as a description of the work activity, identification of hazards, and control measures to mitigate risks.\n\nThe Board officer found that the traffic management plan provided by the employer did not include a description of the work activity or identification of hazards, as required by section 18.3.2(2). The plan only contained generic information and did not address the specific risks present at the worksite.\n\nThe Employers' Adviser argued that the traffic management plan was sufficient and met the requirements of the Regulation. However, based on the evidence presented, it is clear that the plan did not fulfill the necessary criteria outlined in section 18.3.2(2).\n\nDecision\n\nAfter reviewing the evidence and submissions, I uphold the Board's decision to impose an administrative penalty of $59,994.04 against the employer. The violations of sections 18.3.1(3) and 18.3.2(2) were clearly established, as the employer failed to provide adequate risk assessments and a comprehensive traffic management plan. Therefore, the original penalty is upheld, and the employer is required to pay the specified amount."

The employer was found to have a worker working above 10 feet without a fall protection system in place, despite the worker wearing a full body harness. The Board officer determined that while the employer had exercised due diligence in other areas, the fall protection violation still occurred under their supervision, leading to the issuance of the order. The Review Officer referenced a previous decision where due diligence did not apply to this specific violation, emphasizing the precise language of the regulation. Ultimately, the original penalty was upheld as the employer's defense of due diligence did not apply in this case."

The initial order in 2012 led to changes in the joint committee setup, including a central joint committee disbanded in 2015. Subsequent variation requests were made, with disagreements from unions representing the workers leading to a review in October 2023. The review officer directed the Board to consider the hospital campus as a single worksite, clarify the status of Resident Doctors as workers, and assess the adequacy of the proposed joint committee structure. Ultimately, on April 8, 2024, the Board determined the hospital campus as a single workplace and confirmed Resident Doctors as workers of the employer. The decision upheld the employer's request for eight local joint committees without a central joint committee, considering the internal safety and prevention department's role in addressing sitewide health and safety issues. The original penalty was upheld with the new decision."

The worker alleged that the employer's disciplinary proceedings amounted to bullying and harassment and were not adequately addressed. The worker provided evidence that the employer's investigations were unfair and biased, as not all witnesses were interviewed and only one-sided accounts were considered. Despite the worker's complaints and evidence, the Board officer found the employer's response reasonable. However, after a review conducted by Kevin Rooney, it was determined that the employer did not comply with its obligations under the Act and relevant policies regarding workplace bullying and harassment. As a result, the original decision was varied, and an order was issued to the employer to address the worker's complaints appropriately."

    "summary": "The review decision letter outlines the employer's dispute of the Board's decision to impose an administrative penalty for violations of various sections of the Regulation. The employer contested the orders under sections 4.3(1)(a), 5.10(1), 5.38(2), and 7.7(1)(b) but the review officer considered all cited orders in determining the penalty. The employer's defense included increased due diligence in their pipe rail inspection program, with records provided to demonstrate compliance. Despite the employer's efforts, the review officer found violations of sections 4.3(1)(a) and 4.39(1) based on the evidence and submissions. Ultimately, the original penalty of $87,187.95 was upheld by the review officer."

As a result, the citations of $629.87 each for the violations were upheld, totaling $2,519.48. The original penalty imposed on March 8, 2024, was therefore upheld in this review conducted by Review Officer Alice Edwards."

    "summary": "Issue: The employer, a home and garden improvement company, was issued an administrative penalty of $391,534.13 for violations of sections 3.17(1), 5.38(2), and 16.5(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation during an inspection on February 6, 2024. The employer requested a review of the penalty, arguing that it should be assessed as a location violation due to the separate classification unit of a related business, D, and that the penalty is disproportionate to their moral blameworthiness.\n\nReasons: The employer's representative submitted that the penalty calculation was inconsistent with the law and policy, emphasizing the separate nature of the businesses under one organizational entity. The ER also argued for a reduction in the penalty amount based on moral blameworthiness. The ER's submissions contained confidential information, but the Review Division disclosed them to the participating union, citing the need for natural justice and lack of explanation for confidentiality claims.\n\nDecision: After considering the employer's arguments, additional comments from the Board, and applicable policies, the Review Officer upheld the original penalty of $391,534.13. The Review Officer noted the authority under the Workers Compensation Act to conduct the review and make a decision based on the merits and justice of the case. Despite the employer's assertions regarding the separate nature of the businesses, the penalty for the violations on February 6, 2024, was upheld without variation. The Review Officer emphasized the balance of probabilities standard of proof in reaching the decision."

The RAP states that the employer failed to ensure that the confined space was safe for entry and work, as the worker was not adequately protected from the hazards of flammable vapors. The employer did not have a confined space entry program in place, nor did they provide appropriate training or equipment to the workers entering the confined space.\n\nDecision\n\nAfter reviewing the evidence and submissions provided, I uphold the Board's decision to impose an administrative penalty of $43,590.18 against the employer for violations of section 9.12 of the Regulation and section 24(1) of the Act. The employer's failure to properly identify the confined space and ensure the safety of workers entering it led to the worker's injury in a fire incident. The penalty is justified based on the evidence presented, and the employer's lack of compliance with safety regulations. The original penalty is upheld."

The key issue was whether the applicant's request for an extension of the 45-day statutory time limit to request reviews of these decisions should be allowed. The applicant claimed she initially emailed her request but did not follow the proper online steps, leading to a significant delay. However, the review officer found that there were no special circumstances that precluded the applicant from filing the requests on time. As a result, the application for an extension of time was denied, and the original decisions from August 17, September 29, and November 3, 2023, were upheld. The review officer, Nick Attewell, concluded that no injustice would result from denying the requests for review."

The Board's investigation revealed that the stairs were not constructed according to the engineering drawing provided, resulting in inadequate support and eventual collapse. The employer's failure to ensure the safety and structural soundness of the stairs constituted violations of workplace safety regulations and the Act. Despite the employer's argument that they were not responsible for inspecting stairs designed by a professional engineer, the Board found that they still had a duty to ensure compliance with safety standards. Therefore, the original penalty was upheld based on the evidence of the violations and the employer's responsibility for workplace safety."

    "summary": "The key issue in the review was the imposition of an administrative penalty of $8,597.75 on the employer for violations of sections 9.1, 9.9(1)(a), and 9.30 of the Regulation related to confined space entry maintenance work. The review officer, Kevin Rooney, found that the employer had failed to develop written procedures, conduct a hazard assessment, and ensure continuous ventilation in the confined space as required by the Regulation. Despite the employer's argument of acting with due diligence, the review officer upheld the Board's decision to impose the penalty, citing the employer's failure to comply with safety regulations. The original penalty was upheld in this case."

    "summary": "The key issue in this review was the Board's decision to issue an order to the employer under section 4.3(2) of the Regulation. The employer failed to ensure that a concrete pump was certified by a professional engineer after a previous incident. The review officer, Seeley Munro, considered the evidence provided by the Board, including interviews with relevant individuals and documentation. It was found that the employer did not provide necessary information to the engineering firm for a proper inspection, yet still put the pump back into service without full certification. As a result, the original penalty was upheld, and the employer was found in violation of section 4.3(2) of the Regulation."
